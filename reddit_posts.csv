0,Acolyte Archive Spreadsheet and Analysis,FFRecordKeeper,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8lk75s/acolyte_archive_spreadsheet_and_analysis/,23/05/2018,79,"So with the Acolyte Archive coming out in about a week I thought I'd go ahead and get the updated spreadsheet  [posted](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vrgxt3axvUTCaeCzdB_f6oDS4p1yvgXR).  I created a spreadsheet that shows all the items you can select (after your pulls) and elemental+ on it.  I've made a few revisions to the spreadsheet and assuming they don't change it from what was released in JP it should be accurate to help you see your options.  A through overview of how it works and the general books was written by /u/pintbox [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8jjucj/analysis_of_acolyte_archive_selection/).  Echoing pintbox **pull on as many banners as you can before picking anything** to see what you get and what gaps are filled first.

u/Randomguy6644 also put together an analysis which is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8kri2h/randoms_im_a_new_player_what_do_i_pick_on_the/) and focuses on new players and making sure they get a number of helpful effects (like Last Stand, Astra, etc.).  I'll focus a bit more on getting good elemental+ gear on each of your picks (which is important for newbies but not as important as the stuff from Random's guide) and more important to players who have those things or are working on elemental teams.  I posted most of this as a comment on pintbox's analysis but people said they thought it would be useful to post again as it's own thread closer to the release.  I'll also point out a few interesting or nice items I noticed that might be overlooked.  Anyway...onward!

**Vol I** 
First banner is all SBs.  Sun Blade for WoL might be worth it if you really need I relics.  The Air Knife from V Lightning Steel from X and Kaiser Shield from FFT are all Element+ (Wind, Lightning, and Lightning respectfully) and depending on your needs any would be decent.

**Vol II** 
Again old Unique SBs.  Leila's Dancing Dagger from II gives a rare hastaga in that realm if you don't have one (probably what I'll pick).  Gordon's Flame shield gives Moderate fire resist (not minor) so it's an unusual armor and can be used against Tiamat with a wind resist accessory.  If you need a medica for I there's better ones later, but Sarah's Healing Staff also has a Holy Boost.  Garnet's Asura rod is a +holy sage stick that Raines or Hope could utilize (Thanks u/Randomguy6644).  Out of the rest of the +elemental weapons Bartz's Cloak stands out since it gives en-wind and Fujin's wind+ Shear Feather is a mage dagger with a unique affliction break +party phys blink.

**Vol III** 
Healer SSB Volume...pick a medica for realm coverage.  

**Vol IV** 
This is another one where you'll probably pick a element+ since all these SSBs are pretty dated.  The ones I found the most interesting were Ingus' Gaia Blade which is earth+, Sephiroth's Glove where the SB gives you en-dark and is a dark+ armor, Cid's Goggles for the wind boost armor, or Quina's Golden Hairpin for the rare water+.  There's a few other decent selections here (for example Iris White Choker if you need a XV hastaga though using your healers bars to haste is always a risk) or getting something for realm coverage (like Ace's Akademia deck for a 40% party heal).  Rinoa's Guise is a earth= light armor mages or most earth knights could use (Thanks u/rainevangelion).   ( Palom's Asura rod is a +holy sage stick that Raines or Hope could utilize (Thanks u/Randomguy6644).  Elena's Elena Special is a fire+ thrower which Locke, Bartz, and Refia can use well (Thanks u/Xetherion).  One more option is Dorgann's Wind+ sword which (I believe) is the only wind+ sword in the game right now. Of course it all comes down to what you have and what you need (and what you pull in these draws).

**Vol V** 
This book is all buffing SSBs so pick one you need for party coverage (need another stacking mage buff, or haste or last stand with your ATK buff...they're here!).  You should probably pick one for a realm you don't have a decent buff in but in a vacuum Quina's Golden Hairpin again with that rare water+ is also on here. Though it won't be a good stat stick (since whips can't be used by many) Krile's old Fire Lash with fire+ and a decent mage buff set (hi regen, haste and mag boost) or Papa's Wizard's Gloves ( Mage boost, haste and quickcast 3) would be good in a mage team and would stack with something like Rikku's USB.  Ramza's Shout is on here for newbies trying to get their teams up and running and Alph's Deployment tactics has radiant shield which can be great for turtle strategies.

**Vol VI** 
Alright...into the Bursts. This book is all healing so again look at what realm coverage you need for medicas.  A few that stand out are Sarah's Light Robe (which is Holy Boost and gives magic blink plus instant and hi regen on the c1), Relm's Magical Brush (which gives last stand and has an instant c1), Selphie's Nunchaku (which gives a good res boost and again...instant c1), Eiko's Hamelin with the crit fix for physical teams (c1 physical blink), Penelo'a Doom Mace (which is last stand like Relm, and a higher cure instead of the damageplus the c1 also has hi regen), Larsa and Iris Princely Rainment and Moogle plushie (for stats blink/astra), Vanille (for the instantcast BSB healing though no healing on c1), and Duece's Akademia Uniform (healing and boostga, instant C1, character can use bard buffing skills).  As you can see there's quite a few good ones to fill your realm needs.

**Vol VII** 
Massive list of BSBs to choose from.  This one is probably one of the most subjective so I'll just point out a couple interesting/good ones I noticed.  Maria's Rune-Graven Bow is still excellent in Magicites as is the Emperor's Demon's Rod (has a dark boost on rod but the BSB can be used in golem runs too as it's wind/dark).  Bartz's Guise Fire BSB is on here (with a fire+ armor) along with Locke's Sash (fire+ armor) and Papa's Lilith Rod (which is a fire+ rod).  The only other rare element+ I noticed was Rude's Gloves which is a earth+ fist that Earth Monks can use to boost their game. /u/ZeroEdgeir also noted that Seph's BSB has the only dark+ katana available which could be really useful for dark ninjas.

**Vol VIII** 
Same as the last banner...there's a lot of decent BSBs on here so I'll be pointing out a few I noticed.  Maria's Rune-Graven Bow and Rude's Gloves are on here also so if you want them and need something else on the previous banner you have a second shot here.  Emperor's BSB here is an earth+ rod so that could be good for an earth mage (and is apparently the only native earth boost rod thanks to /u/SkyWanderer).  Gogo with his water+ rod is also a rare water+ rod.  Strago's Cloak is a rare water+ armor and a water infuse magical BSB.  CoD's Bizarre Staff is a dark+ weapon with a party haste, doom (for all your dark user magical team) and a PARTY Mag/Mind buff.  Raines is also on here if you don't have it yet and want it (dark+ magical fist). Finally Montblanc's Firewheel Rod gives a party Mag/Def boost (so it won't stack with Raines BSB) and can cover fire, ice, and lightning if that's what you need (no elemental+ though).  It should also be noted that the only piece of ice+ gear on any of the books is on here (that isn't a moogle) with Lulu's robe (though the BSB isn't great).

**Vol IX** 
The final book has a pretty small selection and seems very hit or miss.  Meia's Arc Mirage is a water magical BSB (wiich there's only a few), Munwu's is his new Holy magical BSB, Rydia's Sleipnir's Tail is a rare earth magical BSB (if you didn't pull it on the recent water banner), Relm's Magical brush reappears here with it's medica and last stand, and if you don't have Alph's Veil of Wiyu with his summon/wind BSB I highly recommend it as it was instrumental in my sub 30 golem runs and Midgardsormr completion. Garnet's Dagger of Resolve is a lightning+ mage dagger that also has good mind for those mages running hastaga (thanks u/Randomguy6644).

So hopefully this gives you some extra insight into items to look at or helps you consider some things you may have missed in your own analysis.  If you want to post ""What should I pick"" questions here you can and I'll try to answer (remember my own opinions so they could be subjective) but I'm sure there will be an official post for those questions once it's released.  /u/Anti-Klink also pointed out that power creep is a real thing and a lot of these are outdated or will be (such as 6\* +wind swords, +dark katanas, + wind mage daggers, etc,) so before just grabbing something like that think about what you might be pulling for in the future (or wait on a pull until you see if you get something better)."

Keke gawked as the Callisto approached the shores of Nyarlothep. The sun shone brightly while dozens of catgirls marched across the docks, barking orders and delivering cargo to and from accompanying ships that had made port nearby. The air was salty, and a flock of birds flew overhead before descending upon a lighthouse surrounded by walls of gray brick in the distance. She put her hands on the railing and leaned forward, squinting.

“I’ve never seen such a large lighthouse,” Keke said with her mouth agape.

“Nay, neither have I,” Ceres said with equal admiration in her voice. “I await the moment that I fall on one knee before the queen.”

“That will be some time,” Cailu said, joining them at the railing.

“I guess I’m realizing I never asked before,” Matt said, appearing behind Cailu, “but just how big is Nyarlothep, anyway?”

Cailu paused. “Larger than the sum of the four islands.”

“Spectacular,” Ceres marveled, her hands clapping together.

As the ship came closer to the port, Keke frowned at the structures. Many were simple designs made of brick or stone and molded into box-like shapes. They bore arched roofs laden with thatching. The work was immaculate.

“I’ve never seen such thorough thatching,” Keke said. “We could use that back on Ni.”

“It is to be expected,” Cailu said with indifference. “Nyarlothep is made up of the greatest minds Nyarlea has to offer. Any two islands will be wanting in comparison.”

“Rivaled only by its dangers, I would imagine,” Ceres said.

“Yes.”

When the ship docked, Keke and Matt were the first ones off, Ceres close behind them. Cannoli and Cailu were the last to disembark. Cannoli maintained a distance, averting her gaze whenever she and Keke locked eyes. Keke struggled for something to say but came up short each time. Now wasn’t the time, and she wasn’t about to make their trip any more awkward if she could avoid it. She could try again when she and Cannoli had a moment to themselves.

Keke and Matt turned to see Cailu speaking with Portia at the base of the boarding plank. After a time, the two nodded, and Portia stepped back onto the ship.

“See you soon!” Portia waved from the ship. “Keke! Cannoli! I’ll miss you!”

Keke waved back and made no effort to mask the sadness she felt.

“She’s staying here, huh?” Matt asked with a hint of irritation in his voice.

“Yes,” said Cailu. “We will not be long. Besides, her work aboard the Callisto was remarkable. She should continue her training on larger vessels, should she have the opportunity in the future.”

*That would mean she leaves Ni…* Keke looked from Cailu to Matt. Matt’s hand tightened around hers. She used her thumb to rub the skin between his pointer and thumb fingers. He turned his head toward her, and she did her best to offer him a look that said things would be okay. He opened his mouth, shut it, then nodded.

“Thanks,” Matt said with an obviously reluctant tone.

Cailu cocked a brow but nodded. “Exceptional work should be rewarded.” He brushed by Matt, his cape billowing in the wind behind him. Kirti and Zahra joined him, flanking his sides, and he gestured for Keke and the others to follow.

“So, where are we?” Matt asked after a few minutes of walking the port.

“This is the Port of Elliot,” Cailu stated, waving to a passing catgirl who’d flashed him a disarming smile. Cailu offered a casual smile of his own.

“The Port of Elliot,” Ceres said behind them in awe. “Why does the port have a man’s name?”

“The man who helped construct it bore the same name,” Cailu continued. “The catgirls of the time insisted it be named after him.”

Keke considered his words. Nyarlothep had been considered the mainland since long before her time. How many generations had passed since this ‘Elliot’ constructed the port?

It was said that back when catgirls were still crafting tools from sticks and stones, Saoirse had appeared to them in the heart of Nyarlea.

Old fables and stories regaled Saoirse as a goddess of kindness and infinite knowledge. She taught them how tools and structures were made. In the same breath, she spoke of a prophecy. Mystical creatures known as men would appear and bestow their wisdom upon them. Creatures she herself would deem worthy of their lands. Together, they would learn to become more civilized with newfound knowledge, and their numbers would grow.

At first, it was the men who brought a wealth of technology and developments the likes of which they’d never seen. Over time, however, catgirls become more sophisticated and intricate. After a while, they no longer needed the men to guide them, and soon they were at the helm of power. They built a government, then conquered the surrounding islands.

Keke wondered how much Elliot had contributed to that endeavor.

“This way,” Cailu beckoned.

The Port of Elliot was larger than any Keke had seen thus far. Dozens of gray stone docks stretched out into the water like enormous fingers searching for purchase. Many homes they passed by were two or more stories high, and each catgirl moved with purpose. The roads were structured like a series of nets, crossing and zigzagging into a myriad of pointed shapes. Wagons and carriages passed on occasion, the women inside wearing enough jewelry to sink Portia’s sloop.

Nyarlothep may as well have been its own world.

“How long will it take to get to, uh, the capital?” Matt asked as another carriage caught his attention, passing by in haste.

Come to think of it, Cailu hadn’t mentioned the capital’s name.

“Ronona,” Cailu stated as he came to a larger house on the side of the main road. Above the door was a plaque that said, ‘Windrunner’s Carriages.’ “Wait here.” Cailu pushed the door open, and a handbell rang before he shut it behind him.

“What an incredible place,” Zahra said after a bout of uncomfortable silence, her arms crossed. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

“It’s… it’s a little intimidating,” Cannoli said barely above a whisper.

Catgirls carrying large wooden crates walked by, large red X’s painted on each side. Keke marveled at how effortlessly they moved them. Not a bead of sweat could be seen on their bodies.

“I wonder what the ocean is filled with around here,” Keke said, looking at Cannoli with a smile. Cannoli looked away, her expression vacant.

*Cannoli, I’m not the one hiding away,* Keke thought, recollecting their prior conversation.

“Terrors,” Kirti said, flashing a wicked smile. “Many, many terrors.”

Cannoli whispered something, but Keke didn’t catch it. Judging from Kirti's giggle afterward, she clearly found something amusing in it.

*I need to make sure she’s okay before I leave.*

The conversation died afterward, relief flooding Keke’s veins when Cailu reappeared.

“The carriages have been arranged,” said Cailu. “We have two hours until they arrive.”

“Thanks, Cailu,” said Matt.

Cailu nodded. “With that said, the journey will be a long one. It will be two weeks before we arrive in Ronona.”

Keke couldn’t hide the surprise in her voice. She gasped. “Two weeks?”

“Yes,” Cailu continued, “and our first major stop will be at Irisil. We will make necessary preparations there, then continue our journey.”

Matt rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I don’t suppose we have time for a drink or some sort of pick-me-up.” Matt must’ve seen how Cailu’s expression changed because he jumped right into an explanation. “I mean, it’s just… we’ve been riding on a boat—”

“Ship,” Ceres corrected. A brief silence passed. “Sir Matt.”

“Ship,” Matt continued. “So I was hoping we might get a short break before we have to take another ride somewhere.”

“Very well,” said Cailu. “To ensure we do not leave the carriage attendants waiting, however, I will accompany you.”

Keke snickered.

“Oh… okay,” Matt said, rocking his lower jaw.

“My, my,” Kirti mused with a finger to her lip, “you two are entertaining.”

“Where should we go?” Zahra asked, an eagerness in her voice Keke hadn’t heard before. “I would love to try some of the local food and drink. This looks nothing like Ichi or San.”

“I will offer a suggestion when we arrive,” said Cailu. He took the helm once more, waving them along to follow. “Come.”

Cailu brought them to a section of the city separated by a long set of stairs. At the cliff’s edge was its lighthouse, a tall wall of brick surrounding the land mass. Three buildings stood before them, each atop a small hill. The houses were distinct enough from one another that Keke felt she could put each one inside of the other, like putting small boxes into larger ones.

Muffled music played from within the building directly ahead of her.

*Winona’s Secret,* Keke read.

“Winona is the finest tavern owner I know,” Cailu said as he approached the front door.

“I’m sure you say that about all the innkeepers,” Matt commented, taking to his side.

Cailu’s lips formed into a thin line as he regarded Matt. “This will give us time to discuss what happens from here.”

The tavern was absolutely breathtaking. At least compared to anything Keke had ever seen. She counted no fewer than twenty tables, which didn’t even account for any booths. Grinning catgirls littered every table, and mugs filled with frothy liquid adorned each patron’s hand. At the far end of the room was a woman with pastel-violet hair and furry ears. She sang with her eyes closed, her hands dancing delicately between the strings of a harp.

“That’s beautiful,” Cannoli commented with a gasp.

Keke was glad to hear *something* out of Cannoli’s mouth.

“I must agree,” Ceres said softly as she observed the crowd. “It gives me immense joy to see the patrons do their part to avoid making noise while she sings.”

“Makes me afraid to talk,” Keke mumbled.

“Yeah, me too,” Matt said, chuckling.

“There,” Cailu said quietly, pointing to a corner booth to their right. He took his seat first, taking great care not to sit on the cape, and pulled the chair closer to the table.

Keke took a spot next to Matt, and to her surprise, Cannoli took to his opposite, her hand on his knee. Kirti and Zahra took flanking chairs next to Cailu, and Ceres sat beside Keke, her hands in her lap.

“So, what—” The words were barely out of Matt’s mouth before a waitress appeared beside their table.

“Good afternoon! My name’s Lucielle, and I’ll be your waitress today,” she said, playing with a quill between her fingers. Her accent was different from anything Keke had heard before. It rose and fell in pitch without consistency, sounding like she was chewing on something the entire time. She bore long scarlet hair tied into a braid that rested over her shoulder and striking blue eyes. She had a slight overbite and wore a frilly white shirt that reminded Keke a bit of how the maids on Shi Island dressed. Around her waist was a long, black skirt.

“It is their first time here,” Cailu said, flashing his signature smile, “and I expressed that there was no finer tavern than Winona’s.”

“Right, ya are!” the waitress said. “If that’s the case, then I’ll start ya off with somethin’ light! Will we be needin’ any snacks or food?”

“Three orders of stuffed grimgam,” said Cailu.

“I guess I’ll see how I feel after that,” Matt said.

The others nodded their approval, and Lucielle skipped away.

“Now,” Cailu began, setting his chin upon entwined fingers, “it is important you understand how you conduct yourselves in Ronona. \[Combat Mode\] is deemed ill fit for nobility, and every word you speak can be recounted.”

“I’m a bit nervous,” Keke admitted.

“As am I,” Cannoli said, barely loud enough for Keke to hear.

“‘Tis expected,” said Cailu. “So long as you listen to what I say, there will be no trouble. I suspect Ceres is already aware of proper court etiquette.”

“Yes,” Ceres nodded. “I would be happy to refresh Sir Matt and his Party en route.”

“Excellent. That saves us time and leads me to another matter.” His gaze settled on Cannoli. “I have arranged to have Cannoli escorted to Saoirse’s Sanctuary once we arrive in Irisil. At that time, she shall depart.”

“Wait, she’s not even going to meet the queen?” Matt snapped. “You can’t be serious.”

Cailu didn’t answer immediately. “Saoirse has many temples devoted to the faith. The main body is located in Falselle, Irisil’s neighboring city.” He rested his hands on the table, his gaze now focused on Matt. “A \[Bishop\] will escort her the rest of the way.”

“I see,” said Cannoli. “Thank you.”

Keke balled her hands into fists on her lap. In less than a week, Cannoli would no longer be in their Party.

&#x200B;

2,The Shadow Ninja a Monk/Rogue build! Master the Shadows!,BaldursGate3,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15nmllt/the_shadow_ninja_a_monkrogue_build_master_the/,10/08/2023,52,"Hey all, many are new to DnD thanks to BG3, and may have some questions regarding how to make a ninja in BG#.  So I decided to make a video on it to help smooth things out! This is a very fun build, and at the end of the day, \***YOU\*** play it how you want.   Whether it be multiclassing Gloomstalker in the mix, or even Running Open Hand Monk! Or addingdevil sight from warlock into the mix! Make it how you want it to be/feel.

This guide contains a basic overview of the monk class, more specifically the Way of Shadow, and then a quick bit on the Thief rogue, followed by Origin/Race and stat options, with a level by level guide up to level 9, from there it's your decision on where to go. There are timestamps to skip to the parts you care about.

I'm still pretty new to Youtube, and hope I made a solid enough guide on one of the more requested builds. If you all have any advice on how to make my vids better, or to make this build better, please let me know. This felt like it took me forever to edit.

Video link here:  
[https://youtu.be/4eClxtUBhEA](https://youtu.be/4eClxtUBhEA)

&#x200B;

=======================================

# TL; DW

 I'll also post the summary of the build for people who have difficulty hearing, below! For more details, on the decisions, I go over some of it in the video.

======================================

**Roles:** Striker, *Frontline\**, *Specialist\*\**  
*\*Monks have ways to avoid damage in melee but are still pretty squishy. Don't use this as your main tank.*   
*\*\*Can easily be your lockpicker/pickpocket and stealth user if you grab the associated backgrounds or when you pick up your rogue levels.*

&#x200B;

**Origins:** Asterion, Dark Urge or Custom

**Races:** Drow, Duergar, Lightfoot Halfling, Half Orc, Asmodeus Tiefling, Deep Gnome

**Backgrounds:** Whatever you want! I prefer acolyte for flavor reasons, But choose Charlatan or Urchin if you need this char to be a lockpicker. 

**Stats:**

|Balanced Statline|Powergame/Min-Max|
|:-|:-|
|10 Str|8 Str|
|16 Dex|17 Dex|
|13\* Con|13 Con|
|10\* Int|8 Int|
|16 Wis|16 Wis|
|10 Cha|8 Cha|

\**drop the Int to 8 and bring con to 14 if you don't plan to take the Tavern Brawler feat*

&#x200B;

**Feats to consider:**

ASI - Always a solid option as in a pointbuy game, stats are precious. 

**Mobile** \- This lets us dart in and out of combat since the monks aren't really designed to take damage compared to other martials. 

**Tavern Brawler** \- this can create some very strong damage potentials if you can manage to keep high strength, though for best results try to keep your DEX higher than Str. This is real min-maxy so don't worry about picking it if you're not comfortable with trying it.

**Polearm master** \- Monks can use Spears and Staves and those extra opportunity attacks could be neat. Would be better if we can use stunning strike during our reaction. (you can on tabletop)

**Athlete** \- Increases jump distance and increases your Str or Dex 

&#x200B;

=====

# Leveling Guide

=====

*If you need his character to cover the specialist role, more specifically with Lockpicking/Pickpocketing you can start as a Rogue at level 1 and then proceed into monk, Although the Monk doesn't TRULY come online until level 5 in my opinion.* 

**Level 1: Monk -> Skill proficiencies in:** Stealth and Insight or Athletics. 

**Level 2: Monk 2** 

**Level 3: Monk 3 -> Way of Shadow**

**Level 4: Monk 4 -> ASI or Feat, recommend Mobile or Tavern Brawler** (although at this early in the game we might not have ways to get more STR to abuse that sweet damage)

**Level 5: Monk 5 -** *Now we can start getting some stuns off. Try to use them on tough opponents or annoying casters (the tough opponents have a good chance to resist, so be warned)  Use your flurry of blows sparingly since we don't have a lot of Ki points yet.* 

**Level 6: Monk 6 -** *Now we have our sweet shadowstep jump. Keep an eye on where your character is standing. While stealthed your cursor will tell you if an area is in low light/obstruction so you can teleport to and from those locations.* 

**Level 7: Rogue 1 ->** Get skill in Sleighe of Hand if you don't already have it or whatever else you prefer. Expertise in Sneak, Sleight of Hand, or Perception. - *(Sleight of Hand and Perception Checks can be save scummed to succeed if you want, but it feels wrong haha)*

**Level 8: Rogue 2**

**Level 9: Rogue 3 -> Thief for that sweet sweet extra bonus action.**

**Level 10+ -> Whatever you prefer :) See final builds below.**

**Final Builds:**

* I'd propose a final build of 8 Shadow Monk / 4 Thief Rogue - This will get us a total of 3 ASI/Feats and Evasion/Still Mind from the monk. 
* 6 Shadow monk/3 Gloomstalker/3 Assassin - Can make a potent ninja assassin that can murder things with their alpha strike. But can still be decent after the first 2 turns.
* 8 Openhand Monk / Thief Rogue I think this is actually the most optimal variant of this build. Openhand Monk does more damage and control and has ways to heal itself and restore KI points.

That being said, Shadow monk \*CAN\* provide control by dropping darkness or silence on certain enemies, and Shadowstep is a really good gap closer. 

===============

# Build Caveat

================

I personally think that Openhand makes a better Ninja since it has:

* Ways to buff ALL unarmed strikes you do (which will stack with various other sweet monk items)
* Can inflict conditions with flurry of blows suck as Prone and Push (and I loooove knockbacks in this game)
* and **Wholeness of Body**: Heals you for a decent amount and regains half your Ki points. For 3 turns you have an additional Bonus Action and regain 📷 1 Ki point per turn. Recharges on a Long Rest. (which means we'll have 3 bonus actions to play with)

Whereas Shadow Monk provides:

* Spell like abilities that cost 2 Ki each -
   *  **Pass Without a Trace** \- Decent aoe stealth move, though I've never had to use it in BG3 with how stealth mechancis work.
   * **Darkness** \- Good for providing cover for your monk and also preventing enemy ranged characters/casters from shooting in or out of the darkness (Though they can still drop an AoE on it)
   * **Silence** \- Excellent for stopping casters in their tracks or from preventing people calling reinforcements.

# Items guide (minor spoilers)

===================================

Will provied BG3 Wiki links to some great items to help you during your campaign

 [Corellon's Grace - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Corellon%27s_Grace)  \- Solid early game staff that will last you quite some time.

 [The Graceful Cloth - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Graceful_Cloth) \- very good chest that will last you most of your career

 [The Sparkle Hands - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Sparkle_Hands) neat early game combo with other Lightning charge items like  [The Speedy Lightfeet - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Speedy_Lightfeet) 

 [Gloves of Cinder and Sizzle - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Gloves_of_Cinder_and_Sizzle) \- VERY good gloves to add solid dmg and provides a ranged option every now and then.

 [Sentient Amulet - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki (bg3.wiki)](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Sentient_Amulet)  \- Perhaps one of the best items you can have as a monk. The short rest AoE option is always nice. 

\-----

**Other weaps** (if you have proficiency you'll be able to turn all of these into dex weapons, but you can only sneak attack if they have finesse property)

7,Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor’s Edge,wiiu,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/7lf71f/ninja_gaiden_3_razors_edge/,22/12/2017,3,"I really enjoy NG2 on Xbox 360 but I’m having a terrible time with Razor’s Edge. I’m playing on easy mode and i get stuck in autododge on most big fights and all boss fights. I just fought 3 alchemists with the girl and I ending up stopping pressing buttons except light attack by the end of it. Nothing I was doing worked. They block most attacks. They spam ranged attacks that I can barely dodge. I have so few uses of nimpo. The enemies crowd me so I can’t get Space to aim at rocket launcher guys or charge up any attacks. 
I feel like I’m missing something important. What supersucks is you get penalized karma by autoattacking so I can’t afford upgrades. The game needs a proper easy mode where enemies calm the fuck down. 
Edit. The game crashed after I got the sythe. I went back to NG2. It’s so much more fun. On acolyte you can use healing items, you can use magic, you can use lots of weapons, you can do all the challenges (those are locked on NG3 hero). It’s just a far more fun game. "

23,Internal Names,LegendsOfRuneterra,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/1anglru/internal_names/,10/02/2024,8,"I figured I would post this so you can distract yourself from all the ""the game is dying"" posts.

This list is computer-generated from comparing the card to its prismatic counterpart. Sometimes, they have different names.

There are other ways ""internal"" names come to be, namely the artwork name or VO name. Thus, this list is not complete.

On the left is the ""card path"", usually consisting of ""Cards/Set<Nr>/<Region>/"" and the name. Sometimes tokens are appended to the main card, e.g. ""Cards/Set3/MtTargon/Zoe/Zoe2"". 

On the right is the name of the prismatic entry, usually ""Premium\_<Name>"". If the name is different from the actual card name, it will appear here.

Some of them are interesting, others are just punny. Either way, enjoy.

26,[500 Gem BSB Select] Elemental Equips,FFRecordKeeper,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8mcynv/500_gem_bsb_select_elemental_equips/,26/05/2018,78,"Some people are going to snatch up a favourite character's burst. Others will grab Squall2, or Raines, or CoD2. Others might select a medica in a missing realm. But some people are after +elemental gear!

This is the guide for you guys. 

Obviously, I'm not saying that +elemental equips are the best choice for this selection. But it is an option. And this guide is simply to be informative on what's available, and why it's useful. Knowledge is power, after all. All the analyses I post will be considering the relic independent of the attached SB, just as relic vs relic.

There will also be a note saying if something will be available to *select* on the Archives. You can read up on +elemental gear on the [Acolyte Archives here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7ruqiu/a_guide_to_upcoming_elemental_equips_the_library/)

#**Fire**

High Summoner's Longstaff|Staff|134 MAG|Braska BSB|Vol. 7/9|
Lilith Rod|Rod|127 MAG|Papalymo BSB|Vol. 7/8
Flame Staff|Staff|126 MAG| Vivi BSB1|Vol. 7/8
Vincent's Gloves|Bracer|24 ATK / 28 MAG|Vincent BSB|Vol. 8
Terra's Armguards|Bracer|24 ATK / 28 MAG |Terra BSB2|Vol. 7/8
|Shura Gloves|Bracer|26 ATK / 18 MAG |Refia BSB|Vol. 7
Locke's Sash|Light Armor|17 ATK| Locke BSB2|Vol. 7
Trueflame Cloak|Light Armor|17 MAG|Rubicante BSB|Vol. 7/8

&nbsp;

**Fire Analysis**

* Fire Thrown is a very valuable asset for some characters. Bartz, Refia, Jecht in the future, among others. However, Volume 4 of the Archives does offer a stronger one in Elena's SBB. But Volume 4 is highly contended for +ele equips.
* Counting only as a stat stick, Braska's BSB is the winner for magic. However, Terra cannot use Staff, which might make you lean toward Papalymo, who has a solid burst in his own right.
* Lots of fire armor choices. Picking up a Magic-based bracer is likely the best best. -2 ATK for +10 MAG vs the ATK based ones. 


#**Ice**

Bablizz Mirage|Thrown|81 ATK / 130 MAG|Reynn BSB|N|
Amp Coat|Light Armor|17 ATK|Snow BSB1|N
Lulu's Robe|Light Armor|17 MAG|Lulu BSB|Vol 8.
&nbsp;

**Ice Analysis**

* Ice Thrower is uncommon. Bartz when he gets his Glint will be a decent user. Plus the mages with Thrown access.
* Armor Choice comes down to ATK vs MAG. 


#**Wind**

|Equipment|Type|Stats|Notes|Archives?|
|-----|------|-----|--------|-----|
Fujin's Shin-Chakram|Thrown|81 ATK/129 MAG|Fujin BSB|Vol. 8|
Gungnir|Spear|131 ATK|Luneth BSB|Vol. 7|

&nbsp;

**Wind Analysis**

* Chakram is nice for Fujin and any other mages trying to use wind with thrown access. (Including Onion Knight.) Bartz can put it to use, as well
* Bartz, Luneth, other Dragoons all appreciate that spear.

#**Earth**
|Equipment|Type|Stats|Notes|Archives?|
|-----|------|-----|--------|-----|
|Rude's Gloves|Fist|136 ATK / 132 MAG|Rude BSB|Vol. 7/8|
Gigant Axe|Axe|140 ATK|Guy BSB|N|
Dorgann's Redoubt|Heavy Armor|17 ATK|Dorgann BSB|N|

&nbsp;

**Earth Analysis**

* Hybrid +Earth Fist. Ninjas can put it to use for Earth ninja moves. Some mages can also use it effectively. 
* Bartz, TGC will appreciate the axe, failing other options. 
* Heavy Armor doesn't have as many uses as Light Armor, but Knights, Bartz, and Cinque can put it to very good use.

#**Lightning**
|Equipment|Type|Stats|Notes|Archives?|
|-----|------|-----|--------|-----|
Spear|Spear|139 ATK|Shelke BSB|N
Abel's Lance|Spear|130 ATK|Kain BSB|Vol. 7|

Raijin's Staff|Hammer|133 ATK|Raijin BSB|N|
Staff of Ramuh|Staff|132 MAG|Garnet BSB2|N|
|Ashe's Defiance|Light Armor|17 MAG|Ashe BSB|Vol. 7/8
|Aranea's Cowl|Helm|17 ATK|Arenea BSB|Vol. 7

&nbsp;

**Lightning Analysis**

* Shelke's spear is strictly better as a stick compared to Kain's. But Kain's might actually see use.
* Dagger of Resolve works on... everyone. Seriously. Everyone. 
* Hammer, limited options. Staff, less limited. But the Dagger is probably an overall better choice.
* Limited options for helms. Ashe's armor is a much better choice.




#**Water**
|Equipment|Type|Stats|Notes|Archives?|
|-----|------|-----|--------|-----|
Mimic's Rod|Rod|132 MAG|Gogo BSB|Vol 8.
Strago's Cloak|Light Armor|17 MAG|Strago BSB|Vol 8.
Qu Garb|Robe|17 ATK|Quina BSB|N|
Paine's Guise|Light Armor|17 ATK|Paine BSB|N|

&nbsp;

**Water Analysis**

* Rare water rod. Just slightly more rare than actual water mages.
* Qu Garb is a bit of a trap. Not many physical guys can use a Robe. The light armors are better choices depending on need.

#**Holy**

Holy Lance (XII)|Spear|133 ATK|Basch BSB|N
Curtana|Sword|131 ATK|Minfilia BSB|N|

Sun Blade (II)|Sword|130 ATK|Firion BSB|N|

Lightbringer (IX)|Sword|128 ATK|Beatrix BSB|N|
Excalibur (IV)|Sword|125 ATK|Paladin Cecil BSB|N|
Mage's Staff (T)|Staff|109 MAG / 142 MND|Ovelia BSB|Vol. 6/9
Holy Rod (VII)|Rod|100 MAG / 141 MND |Aerith BSB|N|
Hope's Gloves|Bracer|24 ATK / 28 MAG|Hope BSB|N|
Light Robe|Robe|17 MAG / 17 MND|Sarah BSB|Vol. 6
Summoner's Garb|Light Armor|17 MAG / 17 MND|Yuna BSB2|Vol. 6|
Rem's Guise|Light Armor|17 MAG / 17 MND|Rem BSB|N|
Lustrous Shield|Shield|17 ATK|Warrior of Light BSB|N|
Leo's Longcoat|Light Armor|17 ATK|Leo BSB|N|

&nbsp;

**Holy Analysis**

* Holy Lance is the strongest option for physical characters. But not strong enough to justify use over the significantly more applicable swords. Hopefully, you're not so desperate to need a +holy sword, they're rather common. 
* Most of the light armors are mostly the same. The bracer is a real stand out. Shield sees less use than light armor.

#Dark

Zeromus Shard|Rod|129 MAG|Golbez BSB|Vol. 8
Terra's Legacy|Rod|128 MAG|Kuja BSB|Vol. 8

&nbsp;

**Dark Analysis**

* Sephiroth's Katana good choice for physical weapons. Useful for ninjas. Vayne's dark fist is hybrid, and also can be nice for ninjas, besides Shadow.
* Plenty of swords to choose from should you need one. Archive does have plenty of options too.
* Raines BSB.
* Cod BSB2 strongest magical stick, pretty good buff attached to it.

#Closing

If there's anything I missed, be sure to let me know. I know that I'm using the JP list, so it's possible that our list could be different, but I wanted to make sure that this was up in time for people to think about their decision.

I hope everyone found this fairly informative."

32,Player Faction Loadouts/Units,Kenshi,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/10cc10r/player_faction_loadoutsunits/,15/01/2023,8,"First time posting here, rarely post in general so apologies if my formatting isn't great.

But that said, Loadouts for your player faction! I can't be the only one who does this, and I'm curious about other people's approaches. I tend to mix it up quite a bit based on my run, but I really like promoting my people by giving them specific gear sets to get them in to particular roles as they advance in skill. For example, on my current run my faction is the Rust Ninjas, and so far they have 4 ranks/roles.

* Genin (Trainee): I equip them with Assassins Rags, Drifter's Leather Pants, Leather Turtleneck, wooden Sandals, and a Wakizashi. Once they get enough Dex and Attack/Defense, I move them to a specialization. 
* Shinobi: They keep most of the same armor, but they also get a headband and a katana. Once they get 50 or so Dex I give them a Topper and a Fog Mask and consider them a Jonin.
* Iron Monks (Heavy): To start off their additional training, Armored Rags and Samurai Clothpants and a Plank. Once their strength and attack bonus gets high enough, I switch them to the Gusoku Heavy Armor (mod).
* Rust Acolytes (Ranged): Same light armor as the Genin/Shinobi, but with an Iron Hat! And, naturally, a crossbow. Most of them have Rangers, but there's one Oldworld MkI in the mix as well. 

So yeah! Anyone else make organized loadouts/units for their player faction? I'm curious about other people's choices! Mine are also a bit flavor/backstory based, so I'm curious how much that roleplay element factors in."

36,The Altruist-Military Connection & The MASSIVELY Uninvestigated Now In-Game Evidence The FZ UFO Is A Trigger & Makes The Light NOT Appear When Triggered First (Who Knows What Else It Does??),chiliadmystery,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/2kqgv3/the_altruistmilitary_connection_the_massively/,30/10/2014,77,"EDIT: Btw guys I know my titles are long but it seriously helps when searching things and I also hope they help *not* to waste anyone's time so yeah K to the Iff!  
  
EDIT 2: Just realized my TL;DR was longer than the rest. I suck at being short but I think it flows well enough that I'll leave it. Sorry guys lol
  
EDIT 3: All the people that want to slam game-files, you're not saying anything that wasn't said the first day and you're not saying anything I haven't heard. And TBH I find the people that have the biggest opposition know the LEAST about anything code related so please either quote the code and show me to be wrong **or just skip over my posts if you don't trust me** and continue reading other posts  
  
Alright sup guys  
  
I love this sub and I just want to go back to some of its roots.  
  
First of all, **if you have never clicked ""top"" submissions and sorted them by ""all-time"" you really owe it to yourself.**  
  
And guys I don't mean go read old theories (although I strongly encourage it) But *please* read the comments. The community used to be so vibrant and things were being tested WAY more than spitballed.  
  
Again, I'm not against spitballing or any theory no matter how crazy (Ninjas I have a save with the SD ON TOP of the FZ UFO and not damaged at all, I've tested some insane crazy ish)  
  
Anyways guess I'll TL;DR here and try to keep this short  
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  
  
**TL;DR**  
  
** I strongly believe we need more testing in relation to our spitballing  
** I will be posting testable ideas, 1 per week  
** If you want to help (please do!) then please try and look out for details as you test ex. Time, Character, Weather, Location, Pictures are huge!, Completion, Choice ABC... I know there's a lot but they made it intricate on purpose  
  
Anyways, I need some 100% hunters to investigate seeing the FZ UFO and its light, and also the Chiliad UFO. The altruists mention on their cryptic website how militarized they are and they also overlook FZ and have a direct man-made path to radio tower from their camp. (Actually it's ONLY accessible without flight from their camp). I also firmly believe after much research that the Altruists drew the Mural, and the glyphs on the mountain. The hippies at the camp took the glyphs from the mountain, which leads me to believe the hippies are on to something because they only drew the 2 glyphs needed to see the MC UFO.  
  
So considering the light starts at 1 and gives enough time to ""embrace it"" as well as ""see the eye"" it makes me think that **""our path is lit"" refers to something we can see *from* the FZ UFO?** and also sunrise occurs not long after and Yoga on Mt Gordo would not only embrace the sun (literally the sun salutation) but would fit in with a non-cheating method of getting to the top of Gordo for yoga in time.  
  
Anyways we should see if different dialogue (especially for T) happens after seeing the FZ UFO and going back to the camp. Or seeing the light then going back to the camp. Or both. I also was never able to disprove the claim that the camp is always empty at 3am because my AC seems to be eternally glitched.. started 3 different files and they are always there after I clear the camp.  
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    
  
Also, for all the people that think us game-file people can see everything you could not be more wrong. **I gave the entire community every script for everything ever found and I dare someone to show me the code for the UFO's cloaking. Or the MC UFO Hologram animations. Or the code to open the FZ bunker door (which has been proven in-game we just have no idea how).**  
  
Seriously, saying the Egg or Jetpack or Solomon Mission is cut is like saying the FZ Bunker is cut because we never found it in the files. Well guess what, it's there and so is tons of stuff that NEVER appears in the files. It's the nature of a sandbox game.
  
R* is probably hands down the best sandbox programmers the world has ever seen to date and their design literally was meant to keep us from doing exactly what we do.  
  
Anyways, If you want to help out message/comment and I'll give you even more specific things to try so we can try isolate what's affecting the FZ Light trigger  
  
Kifflom  
  
Oh & Acolyte I saw your shoutout in the comments the other day and trust me brother-brother I'm always here watching! I hope you read this haha cheers man!"

Unmarked and heavy spoilers for both Sea of Stars and The Messenger abound, turn back while you still can. I highly recommend finishing Sea of Stars true ending before reading this and ideally The Messenger too.

**BIG WARNING**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Still here? Alright read on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I really been enjoying Sabotage’s work so I felt like doing a timeline /summary of the verse they been cooking up for fun. There are some interesting things going on and some others that are not so clear.

One of the things I noticed is that some events are in this nebulous state of apparently being long ago but also being super recent, or at least that is the reading I got. (Maybe I just didn’t pay enough attention)

I’ll sprinkle some of my personal theories with italics. If I have any errors I hope this at least serves as a springboard for further discussion and perhaps making a cooler one down the line.

&#x200B;

**Origin - (The Two Alchemists)**

The earliest point we have knowledge about the setting.

This is the original world of Resh’an and Aephorul.

They eventually brewed an elixir of life and became immortal. Their bodies decaying until they had to cover up with the robes they now wear.

They spend countless ages nurturing the world and creating wonders for the mortals.

At some point while they were still friends Aephorul gifted Resh’an the power to turn into The Great Eagle. Aephorul got that power by promising the birdmen that he would grant them mind magic and a god to worship.

*This is one of the big questions right now as Resh’an didn’t know the bird people Aephorul experimented and sacrificed to gain this power until you find out the “familiar magic” in the Sacrosanct Spires.This is so out of place that its part of the reason why Resh’an leaves the party when he finds out about it and hints that Aepheroul’s evil had been going since earlier than he knew of.*

Later on Aephorul grew jealous and resentful of mortals and took to the forbidden arts of alchemy, experimenting with soul, bone, flesh and blood. This marks his turn into the Fleshmancer as he embraced the evil and now released monsters into the world.

Resh’an tried to intervene and lead to a great conflict with great chaos and collateral damage as they fought. During the fight Resh’an found out that the Fleshmancer’s creations had a weakness to Solar and Lunar magic. Thus he began to train those that had such powers into becoming Solstice Warriors to fight against the creatures of the Fleshmancer.

Aephorul wouldn’t stay behind thought and his experiments lead to the creation of Dwellers, incredible powerful creations that could only be damaged by Solar and Lunar magics during an eclipse. Left to heir own devices they would consume and grow until they became World Eaters.

*One of those not clear bits, how did they get that name when there was only one world? Perhaps it was applied retroactively after one actually grew big enough to do just that.*

Resh’an taught the Solstice Warriors to do patrols and eliminate Dwellers before they could get to that point leading to a stalemate. Fearing that Aephorul would create something even worse he used a bold plan to split reality into multiple timelines and parallel worlds.

This lead to him sequestering himself away and becoming The Archivist looking for a solution. Meanwhile Aephorul rejoiced as he had infinite places to mess around and destroy now.

During this time their pact was established “let the fate of each timeline play out on its own” according to Teak’s story.

*And thus their conflict had a more proxy approach:*

*Aepherul creating Dwellers in the hope they would grow into a World Eater and destroy the world*

*Resh’an setting the groundwork for Solstice Warriors to ascend into Guardian Gods that would keep their world safe.*

&#x200B;

**Serai’s World - Past**

This one is hard to fit properly anywhere but given that a lot of the backstory events happened before the game canon I’m putting it first. The last 2 entries are likely the most recent events before Sea of Stars game canon.

&#x200B;

The tech-savvy humans build the Sky Base turning the world into a verdant and wonderful place as it regulated the climate of the world. There are hints that the Cerulean Expanse was a mega city shared by humans and Songsters at this time.

Aephorul arrived and felt this was a good place to carry out his deal with the birdmen, he enslaved the Songsters (B’st people) and got them to work into building Es’tristae to fulfill the role of the “god to worship”

**(Es’Tristae)**

The Songsters lead by T’kor use a ritual to peer the future, find out how the world will be corrupted and the mega city destroyed, the sky base corrupted and his people suffering a terrible fate. There was a light of hope of future heroes but they would need aid.

As the Songsters built Er’tristae they hid a gravity based battery in plain sight to one day return power to the speedball network for the heroes of the future.

*This isn’t really written down anywhere but he must also have done some sort of deal with ‘The Queen that was’ during this time or shortly after, given how Serai hates her and the others fear her return.*

The Sky Base is corrupted and forced to cover the world with thick clouds.

Songsters are brought to the dome to be experimented on until they die out.

Humans are sent to the Catalyst, being turned into cyborgs. *Honestly they are more robots with human souls inside*

The moon falls into the ocean at some point and the Dweller of Dread makes it is home.

Serai is turned into a cyborg.

Serai travels to other worlds in search of Solstice Warriors. *No idea how, we can only speculate that its due her portal slicing tech.*

&#x200B;

**Home World - Past**

Some of these events might go in different order but from the reading of it the Ovates doing this should be the oldest point in the line.

&#x200B;

**(Khukharr the Unyielding)**

The Ovates shape the formless world, creating the islands and the travel golems, Y’eet and X’tol being created first. Khukharr is built to one day prop up Mesa Island which was at sea level. It lacks sentience which it will need to carry out its task on the time fo the flood.

From the essence of the clouds the Ovate created the Sky Giants. The Ovates knew they would become extinct one day and the Sky Giants would take their watch on protecting the world.

The Sky Giants were tasked with 3 tasks: Maintain the balance of the elements, gatekeep the Sea of Stars, help Khukharr gain sentience. This was eventually accomplished when The Great Eagle arrived to help.

**(Mooncradle and the Elder Mist)**

Under the guise of the Great Eagle, Resh’an leads people towards an island encouraging them to settle there. 3 vials were left behind. The first one opened and turned the peninsula into a crescent moon shape and gave birth to the Celestial Willow.

Following a vision they build the town of Mooncradle expecting the arrival of the Children of Solstice. They also began to work on creating Zenith Academy even if they didn’t know how to make it float. When it was done the second vial opened and enchanted the building raising it into the sky.

The final vial opened shrouding the island in mist and giving them the instructions on how to raise and train Solstice Warriors, with their final tasks to seek out Elder Mist once they completed their training.

**(Nomads of the Sea)**

The Docarri nomads wander the sea. During their time wandering they come across the Sea Slug sealing it away as they couldn’t kill it. *The most likely canon event to happen from Nomads of the Sea.*

Eventually they settle on Watcher’s Island as a vision of the young Oracle of Tides tells them they should remain close to the Tower of Ansudlo.

**(The Great Summoning)**

The Molekin and Lizardfolk are in conflict. Eventually this escalates until the Great Summoning, the now defeated Lizardfolk set in motion the events that would draw Sky Serpent in.

With no Ovates left to help control the Sky Serpent the molekin burrowed through the island turning it into a giant musical instrument to lull the Sky Serpent turning it into The Sleeper.

**(The Clockwork Castle)**

The Fleshmancer arrives into this world as he sought a new base of operations. He brings with him a group of kid geniuses and strikes a deal with The Watchmaker to help him build his new castle. His plan was for the castle to control time to prove his superiority over Resh’an. *Seems he wanted to upstage the Vial of Time*

The kids discreetly sabotaged the enchantment making it backfire as they planned to do the best to foil the Fleshmancer as much as they could.

While not serving his initial purpose a perpetual workshop still had its use. As a final touch he ensured that anyone leaving the insides of the castle would instantly age ensuring that anyone that spent too long inside would instantly die upon leaving.

**(Paradise Lost)**

There is an evil Sun Solstice Warrior burning everything around Lucent. Duke Aventry tries to stop him but can’t. Acolyte Two approaches him with an offer on how to gain the power to win.

Duke Aventry uses it falling into the trap of releasing the curse of the Night Shroud upon the island. The Duke defeats the evil Solstice Warrior bringing peace but the night never ended.

During these events Acolyte Three sneaked into the mansion killed Ewilda and planted the seed of evil that would give rise to the Dweller of Woe.

&#x200B;

*Following is a bit of speculation since its not super clear.*

The Fleshmancer creates the seeds of evil that will become the Dwellers and likely seeds many of them around. Its implied that during this time he killed and experimented on most of the Divine Spirits besides the Gorilla Matriarch which was left behind so the Dweller of Torment could feed on her children. *Also my personal theory based on looks is that the Dweller of Torment might have been some sort of Gorilla Patriarch at some point. Also another personal note, I fully expected the Gorilla Matriarch to be Valere’s Ultimate and a bird/phoenix like the one The Bowman rides on to be Zale’s*

Some ancient Solstice Warriors create the Solstice Shrines to test or hide stuff for future generations to find. *This might have happened even before the world split honestly, but leaving it here to link to the next*

Solstice Warriors arrive at Torment Peak, find out the Gorilla Matriarch plight and vow to come back with reinforcements. They forget after they leave.

A second group of Solstice Warriors arrive at Torment Peak, the same thing happens again. Feeling the feeling of wrongness coming from the mountain they seal it away.

&#x200B;

**Home World - The Messy part.**

So according to what the game story spells out the Fleshmancer left when the Dweller of Strife was originally killed since he didn’t have his grand creation anymore. But the game implies that was the event that wiped out most of the Solstice Warriors lead by Headmistress Moyara. Which is super recent in the grand scheme of things. Sooo ???

&#x200B;

Moyara, Romaya and Yomara are born as triplets during a Summer solstice and each take a different path. Solstice Warrior, learning the craft of the fleshmancer and becoming the 1st necromancer and remaining a neutral seer.

Moraine is born in the following Winter Solsitce, or at least the one that brought in the next Solstice Warrior after Moyara. He is implied to be Moyara’s Lunar partner.

Various other Solstice warriors are born during this time, including The Twins. *They really empathize those despite not saying much about them.*

At the height of its power the order had 20+ strong and had done a great job of clearing the Dwellers out until only few remained.

**(Erlina and Brugaves flashback)**

The entire group of Solstice Warriors leaves to fight a Dweller, while successful all perish besides Moraine. *Implied to be the Dweller of Strife, and if going by the comments in game, this is when the Fleshmancer leave the world*

Erlina vows to protect Brugaves no matter what.

Moraine becomes the new Headmaster of Zenith Academy. With only Erlina and Brugaves as recruits and suffering from trauma due how they got wiped out he turns into a harsh trainer for the pair. Brugaves is too slow in his progess for the likes of Moraine and he berates him about it, Erlina tries to defend him.

Erlina and Brugaves lose the admiration they had for Solstice Warriors and try to flee. They don’t make it far but begin to try to look for options less they end up like The Twins and the others. *This shows the first time Erlina starts looking for ‘power’ and Brugaves hangups with being ‘too slow’*

Valere and Zale arrive one after the other a few years later.

At some point the Acolytes approach the pair, they refuse to hear them.

&#x200B;

**Sea of Stars the Game starts here.**

This part is going to be a bit sparse since its mostly the game events themselves.

&#x200B;

Serai arrives into the world and hides as Captain Klee’shae and gathers her merry band. 

Important tidbits: 

The rest of the pirates know about the Sea of Stars, Yolande gets interupted as she is about to say it multiple times.

Seem to also be looking for or know about Solstice Warriors, Valtraid gets interrupted as he was about to say it.

*Big theory time: I have the feeling that the rest of the pirates seem to also be from other worlds. As for what Serai doesn’t want to show her true self to them despite likely traveling through a bunch of worlds looking for Solstice Warriors… it might be the same as why she doesn’t tale Valere and Zale right away, she’s probably not too happy about being a cyborg.*

&#x200B;

**(Game Prologue)**

Valere, Zale and Garl as little kids meet up with Erlina and Brugaves. Zale manifest a bit of Solar magic. The whole bit of the kid’s adventure Forbidden Cave happens here.

Erlina and Brugaves meet with the Acolytes again and are willing to listen to their plans now. They begin to think how to have Valere and Zale avoid the fate of Solstice Warriors too. Erlina comes to the conclusion that she might have to pay a price but doesn’t care as long as Brugaves will be fine. Brugaves wants to make sure to take the kids with them because he wants them free of the duties and be able to be happy.

*During the special training the pair give with Moraine you can see that Erlina wants to tell the kids “you are your own person, don’t just follow orders” or something along those lines but is interrupted by Moraine.*

The kids finish the training and get their mission to go after the Dweller of Woe. The events follow the game until the Tower of Ansudlo with them picking up Serai, being betrayed by Erlina and Brugaves, getting the Vespetine and helping with the creation of Mirth.

&#x200B;

This leads to 3 known timelines:

**1.Bad timeline**: Ansudlo’s door remained closed and the world ended due the Dweller of Strife. Said by Resh’an when you reach that point in game.

Events in all timelines after the events at Clockwork Castle:

Erlina is turned into Elysan’darelle and put in charge of Serai’s World.

Brugaves is turned into Barma’thazel.

Ansudlo’s door opens, the Dweller of Torment is defeated, the Party reach Mesa Island and confront the Dweller of Strife, the Fleshmancer appears and gets his “one hit”.

Garl makes a deal with the Sky Giant council, awakens and purifies The Sleeper -  Wenworth the first Sky Serpent. Gets passage through the Sea of Stars for the Party.

The Party arrive in Serai’s world, B’st joins in, the battery on Er’trieste is used, Resha’an leaves in mind. The assault on Sky Base to turn off the Catalyst, the Artificer emerges, the light of the Sun returns to the world.

The Dweller of Dread is defeated and the moon returns to the sky, many other trails are undertaken and finally the party assaults the Fleshmancer’s Lair. This leads to the other split in the timelines.

**2**.**Regular ending timeline**: The door opens and the party can continue to Mesa Island. Erlina as Elysan’darelle is defeated/killed. Home and Serai’s world are safe, Valere and Zale become Guardian Gods.

**3.True ending timeline:** The door opens and the party can continue to Mesa Island and the Chronophage is used. Erlina as Elysan’darelle is alive. Home and Serai’s worlds are safe, Valere and Zale become Guardian Gods. They visit Garl once a year.

&#x200B;

**Sea of Stars - Epilogues**

Not going to write down all the location based connections to The Messenger here, there are far too many. But one important note Mesa Island = The Island in The Messenger.

Romaya turns Moraine’s staff into the evil talking staff Ruxxtin will eventually wield.

The Artificer turns the Catalyst AI Core into the Clockwork Concierge.

The Ancient Crypt is turned into the Sunken Shrine, or rather into the Shrine that will sink during the flood.

At some unknown point of time the Four Acolytes are merged with the Dweller of Strife becoming the Demon King. The Fleshmancer creates the demon race to serve under the Demon King and apoints Barma’thazel as his lieutenant.

The Flood occurs in Home world as the Sky Giants watch helplessly.

The belief in Solen and Luana faded away overtime to the point they barely have any power by the time of The Messenger.

*This is totally a “The Messenger was the first game” moment, but Solstice Warriors also entirely fade out by the time of The Messenger. Perhaps Resh’an was too busy looking for a solution to keep guiding them forth in the flooded world.*

&#x200B;

**The Messenger - Past**

The backstory that we know off from the Messenger, this mainly comes from the Music Box cutscene that happens really late.

&#x200B;

**(Music Box Cutscene)**

Countless ages pass, the prophetic flood comes leaving only Mesa Island behind. 

*It is likely that the molekin moved in and dug out the Howling Grotto during around this time before going extinct. Also either Malkomud , his descendant or some other molekin earth mage might be the creator of the Emerald Golem*

Humanity survives, adapts, overcomes. Builds a temple between Autumn Hills and Bamboo Creek. They are lead by a wonderful woman known as the Muse and her partner Phantom.

The skies turn red and a war is fought in the skies, the demon army kills all the Sky Giants. They set their sight on the lone island in the world.

Despite their preparations for the upcoming battle the temple is lost against the might of the demons. Muse dies during this time leaving behind only a Music Box for a memento.

With the Music Box in hand Phantom leads the survivors to the western edge of the island where they settle into a hidden village. With his people safe the rage in Phantoms heart guides him to confront the Demon King to try to take him down.

Insulted by this the Demon King put a curse on the Phantom, trapping him within the Music Box, forever playing an organ as a cursed mask sapped his mind and tortured him. The curse would bring the demons back every 500 years to torture humanity and he would be the one keeping it going.

In his rare moments of lucidity he craft The Scroll, attuned to time magic as he knew the fight against the curse would take centuries. His best bet trying to get his people to cooperate across time and with the last of his strength he teleported the scroll into the hideout of his people.

&#x200B;

**The Messengers - (Also Music Box Cutscene)**

Those that tried the use The Scroll saw strange manifestations that not everyone could handle. The few strong enough to handle them became known as Messengers. With the ability to step outside space-time they found the Void, a safe haven outside time.

It was the perfect meeting place in their fight against the endless war against the demons. They create the Tower of Time in here during this time.

Meeting denizens of the future or alternate selves lead to shock among them and thus they opted to conceal themselves becoming the Order of the Blue Robe.

Each generation would have its champion, and they would join the Order after passing on the scroll to the next Messenger. After many cycles one among the reclaimed the Music Box. At some point due the cycles the legend of the Western Hero spreads, which are in truth the previous Messenger passing the scroll to the next one.

Although too powerful to be destroyed the world seemed to respond to their wishes, creating music notes from mysterious energies of the world. One gifted Messenger managed to get two of them which in turn gave the rise to the idea of gathering them all to open the Music Box, travel inside and rescue Phantom.

&#x200B;

*I can’t say I’m fully 100% up to date with the dev commenatry and notes that have come out over the years of all the little details. But I will try to incorporate what I remember and the biggest stuff from the wikia.*

&#x200B;

Short form version of above:

1. Scroll appears in the hideout.
2. The Shopkeeper becomes the first Messenger and first member of the Order of Blue Robes.
3. Many attempts later the successful Messengers form the Order of Blue Robes.
4. Many cycles later, one Messenger reclaims the Music Box.
5. Even more cycles later, one Messenger claims 2 Music Notes and the plan to save Phantom is hatched up.
6. The Ninja becomes the next Messenger.

&#x200B;

Additional events that might go in between the above, after or who knows where, time travel man:

&#x200B;

At some point the Artificer joined the Order of the Blue Robes, though its unknown if he ever was a Messenger *(but probably)*. Additionally Iron Hood, the Prophet *(?)*, the Monk had their turns as Messengers.

Unknown point in time. The Primal Fear makes the Curse of Quills in the Songshroom Marsh turning it into the Quillshroom Marsh.

At one point the Monk set in motion the events that will restore the Riviere Turquese with the help of the Butterfly Matriarch.

The Monk falls prey to the Curse of Quills becoming the Queen of Quills by the time of the Ninja.

The Bowman battles Barma’thazel and takes out his eye.

At some point the Order of the Blue Robes makes a deal with the Greed Demons like Quarble, before then Messengers died a lot and stayed dead. Now they only do if they aren’t saved in time.

The Order of the Blue Robes discover the Corrupted Future. *Now with context from Sea of Stars we can assume the Abomination is a World Eater in the process of eating the world and the moon has been shattered to prevent any Solstice Warrior shenanigans*

The demons have been trying to gain access to the Tower of Time to be able to create further destruction, at the time of The Messenger the Order has been decimated by the real close attempts that have occurred.

&#x200B;

**The Messenger the Game happens here.**

The opening card of The Messenger with people living on the hidden village away from the demons awaiting the arrival of the Western Hero.

&#x200B;

The Ninja is living a boring life in the last village until the demons attack.

The Bowman appears, drives off the Demon King and his army and passes on the scroll to the Ninja telling him to go to the top of Glacial Peak. The Ninja crosses the island battling the demons as he goes along until he reaches the top of the peak and summons the Tower of Time.

During his trip the Ninja meets Ruxxtin, a tiny necromancer that wears huge robes and a massive staff. *Dev commentary implied that the necromancer robes and staff didn’t belong to him. New context from Sea of Stars points that they probably belonged to Romaya at some point.*

He battles the Queen of Quills on the Quillshroom Marsh and joins and “workout” with Colos and Suses on his way to Glacial Peak.

The Ninja passes the tests of the Tower of Time and travels to the future.

&#x200B;

**The Messenger - 500 Years in the Future**

Frees Manfred the last Sky Serpent from under Barma’thazel’s control.

Battles and defeats Barma’thazel.

As with every Messenger he becomes the Western Hero for the next cycle arriving in time to save the Soldier and hand over the scroll. Takes over as the Shopkeeper for the cycle of the Soldier.

Due a miscommunication with the Shopkeeper, Ninja-Shop does not know about sending out Greed Demons to save his Messenger and the Soldier dies for real.

Following a prophecy of a twice-over Messenger that will travel through two timelines the Order of the Blue Robe makes the Ninja take his post as Messenger back and try to follow the prophecy to end the curse once and for all.

The Ninja gathers all the remaining notes. Including one from the Sunken Shrine made from the last remaining power of Solen and Luana.

During his search for the Music Notes, Ninja frees the Monk from the Curse of Quills letting her rejoin the Order and help in her own way.

In order to reach the Corrupt Future where one of the notes is at the Ninja battles and defeats the Demon King in the Forlorn Temple, using his crown as the catalyst to reach that future and recover the Music Note. *Additional dev commentary hints that the Demon King in game might not be its true form at true power, that its true remnants are sealed within the Clockwork Castle*

With all the notes together the Ninja enters the music box and eventually reaches the Phantom. Leading to a fight to break him out of his trance and end the curse.

Bringing Phantom out of the Music Box the curse isn’t quite done, leading to the entire Order of the Blue Rose “doing the thing!” in order to finish it off and gaining peace at long last.

&#x200B;

**The Messenger - Picnic Panic**

Now first off, I have to say I never actually finished this DLC because it came out way after I finished The Messenger so most I know is second hand. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

&#x200B;

Somehow Barma’thazel ends up in an alternate timeline where he is using fear to feed into a seed he has. *I would say this might be a seed of evil that will turn into a Dweller now that we have Sea of Stars knowledge, but apparently the OG plan with the Tower of Thyme was that it would grow up into a beanstalk and would be related to Time Shards.*

When the Ninja arrives to try to stop him he carries out a plan with voodoo magic to create a Dark Messenger with a Dark Greed Demon.

After Ninja slays the Dark Greed Demon, Barma’thazel takes the opportunity to “do the thing!” with the Dark Messenger to empower himself. But he is beaten back by “thing!” from the Order of the Blue Robes.

Still not giving up he absorbs the energy left behind the Dark Messenger into the seed and apparently *(??)* goes back to the main timeline. While there he meets up with Colos and Suses getting them to agree to take care of the plant that will grow out from the seed he carries.

And that’s what we have so far from this plotline. Apparently this is supposed 1 act of 3 with the other two being the “Tower of Thyme” and the “Clockwork Castle”.

With the release of Sea of Stars who knows how or if those plotlines will be followed, given that we see the Clockwork Castle during the game.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

&#x200B;

This is what we know so far of the events before, in-between and throughout the games so far. I hope that Sabotage continues to explore this crazy little world(s?) they made and giving us more wonderful experiences.

I can’t wait to see the answers to some of the mysterious parts might have, what new ones might crop up and hopefully the resolution of the best possible outcome that Resh’an is looking for.

Until then… can someone pass me a time travel scroll or wake me up when the next part of the saga comes out?"
50,"Forum rules, written in a way the average gopher can understand",programmingcirclejerk,400,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/gap4h9/forum_rules_written_in_a_way_the_average_gopher/,30/04/2020,28,"Lately, our central scrutinizer is reporting a decrease in jerking quality. I say this is attributable to newcomers which still don't get the firm grasp of the shaft of PCJerking; something that sadly requires you to be a type astronaut capable of high IQ elucidations.

I, sincerely, hate to do this, but the time has come: The time to state the rules clearly, in a way even the average leftpadder can understand.

# FORUM RULES

**Socialjerking** or politics, directly or even tangentially, is forbidden.

If what you're posting is the subject of multiple warring subreddits, blog networks or hashtags, that's a sign you should leave it outside. The no-socialjerking-or-politics rule is the most ruthlessly enforced. This means  YOU WILL BE BANNED and thus never become a 100xer.

**Jerking style**: This is the rule NPM users don't quite get. 

Practical Jerking style:

- Post titles should actually QUOTE the jerkable content

- Don't post images or videos

- Don't link to PCJ posts

- Don't manufacture jerkable content to link to it (""False jerk"", ""manufactured jerk""). ""The best satire is original sources.""

Useful **Jerking Style** guidelines so you don't embarrass yourself within this sacred lair of Hacker News superstars. **Don't** post or comment:

- Anything that would belong on /r/Programming. Yes, nobody cares here about your opinion on OOP versus FP, ORM versus SQL queries. Go away.

- Anything that could as well be found on /r/ProgrammingHumor

- XKCD references or links.

- Crossposts.(instead, quote the jerkable part as submission title, and link to the source)

- Boring, trite jerks implying ""vim vs emacs"", etc.

- Discussion about PCJ itself (there's /r/metapcj for that)

Enthelechial **Jerking Style**

""The jerking style is not to backlink and take a screenshot. It is to point and laugh from behind a soundproof one-way mirror."" -- J. Chester

## More rules

**Mentioning PCJ outside it**: Forbidden and most likely will get you banned.

**Crazy people**: Don't post things by crazies. . 

**Enthusiastic Youngsters**: Leave them alone, don't post links to them. 

**Bots**: Official bot policy is ""Fuck your stupid bot"", as said by our founder and angel investor, Jacques Chester. If you see a bot, report it. If you interact with a bot, this is considered an offense.

**Harassing other people**: Don't. ""The internet is where people come to be their worst selves and {reddit} site rules describe a Minimum Viable Peoplehood that even flatulent ponies can understand and follow"" -- J. Chester.

**Twitter**: Better not to post twitter links, because this might lead to harassing other people. We are *moral* people.

# Note to elder PCJers.

You, the children of the light, you lesser known acolytes of Touba No He, fearless commanders of efficient Jerk bindings, **YOU** have the mission to report substandard content, or any rule violation. Report the ninja unicorn front end artisanal bootcamp graduates!!"

53,How Wormgod Caress makes me feel,DestinyTheGame,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pg10c2/how_wormgod_caress_makes_me_feel/,01/09/2021,5,"I love Wormgod Caress.

I play Void Titan, none of that fancy-pants hammer shenanigans. I rock the Code of the Protector. Between the subclass and the shoulders I have the following effects:

Melee kills regenerate life

Charged melee kills grant an overshield

Melee kills increase melee damage

It makes your survivability contingent on getting up close and personal with the enemy and smashing that melee button. Is it GOOD? No. I usually come last on kills. I die a lot more than anyone else. The efficacy scales down on higher difficulties where charging in like that will just get you oneshot. It just isn't as efficient as using on-meta weapons and playing defensively.

But I want to tell you about how Wormgod Caress makes me *feel.*

I feel like a mother freaking TITAN. I feel like a monster. A force of nature. An unholy dervish of steel and destruction that can roll into a pack of enemies like an avalanche, laying about me with fist and lead and the directed power of the blessed light until nothing stands around me but dust and ashes. I feel like dregs and acolytes tremble and pray to their dark gods when they hear the heavy footfalls of my boots. Fancy warlock magic? Nah. Stealthy ninja flips? Nope. I am going to STEP UP  into your FACE and I am going to PUNCH THE EVER LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF IT!

Please don't nerf Wormgod because of unintended glitches."

70,List of Mechanics in each Set,hearthstone,200,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b2l81x/list_of_mechanics_in_each_set/,18/03/2019,86,"Since the new expansion is coming up and they may be bringing back themes and mechanics from old expansions, I decided to go through and list all of the mechanics introduced in each expansion.

I’ve listed all of the cards each mechanic got to give an idea how well it was explored. I also added in italics any cards added from later expansions that fit the mechanic. I did not do this for mechanics which became commonly used, such as Rush, Dragon Synergy, Discover, etc. I am certain I have forgotten many cards, so feel free to comment so I can edit them in.

&#x200B;

Edit: I did not include some expansion themes that did not introduce new mechanics. The Portals from Karazhan, Projects from Boomsday, and Spirits from Rastakhan. These are all themed similarly but aren't anything new.

Added the Worgen (stat switching) to The Witchwood, and some cards I've missed.

81,Trying for a solo flawless Prophecy Runs? Here's more thoughts and suggestions,DestinyTheGame,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/huul3j/trying_for_a_solo_flawless_prophecy_runs_heres/,20/07/2020,7,"I completed my solo flawless last night and am still coming down from the adrenaline high. There are tons of great guides out there (Datto, Esoterick, Fallout, Ninja Pups, etc...), but I wanted to share my approach so anyone looking to go for flawless has another data point to consider when fine tuning your load-outs and strategies. For reference, I did this on PS4 with a warlock. 

**Armor and Mods**

I leaned heavily into survivability, running the devour tree for all except the big phalanx encounter. Here's the critical choices: 

* Karnstein Armlets. They may seem redundant with devour, but having the health recharge with an uncharged melee kill along with the constant health regen afterwards shouldn't be ignored. 
* Taking Charge and Protective Light mods. I exclusively used masterworked legendary weapons to generate plenty of orbs when slaying mobs, and protective light is great for those ""oh shit"" moments when you are running for cover. 
* I lucked out and snagged Taken Barrier recently, and it was crucial. I never got taken armaments 2.0, but leveraged a Hive armaments and older taken mod when needed. I usually equipped one major resist mod as well.

**Phalanx**

I used the widely recognized Well + Falling Guillotine strat, but how to deal with the Knights? My MVP here was Izanagi's Burden. A 4x honed edge shot is an instant delete button, and paired with the flat arena and giant Knight heads I found this so much easier than multiple Mountaintop shots. If a knight went agro, I'd duck around a corner and wait for that bastard with my sword and spin to win. By the way: don't be stingy on the sword reserve mods. I had to 2-phase one attempt because I ran out of sword ammo. Not ideal. 

**Wasteland and Hexahedron**

MVP: Loaded Question. Lots of guides I watched didn't mention this, and it does absolute work on bunched up thrall, and *especially* the acolytes and acolyte eyes. The latter usually stay tight groups, so if you can land just a couple of bolts into a pack you'll generate enough arc to power a time traveling DeLorean. I used Xenophage in my heavy slot, and a Whispering Slab bow with sympathetic arsenal was a great pair to ignore the slow reload time. I kept a Hive armaments mod on here for infinite heavy ammo. Just a quick note here that made a difference for me: take your time after you dunk the motes. Any knights or snipers will disappear, and you can hang out and mop up the acolytes with loaded question shots or to generate orbs and ammo. 

**Panic Room(s)**

I went back to Izanagi and Falling Guillotine here (paired with Recluse) after trying dozens of different load outs. Maybe I just suck with mountaintop, but trying to kill a knight with one while they are moving around and I need to be cognizant of where I'm standing just didn't fly for me. With the sword, I had a panic ""delete knight"" button if they went agro or spawned right on top of me, and Izanagi let me keep my distance as much as possible. Sure, I missed plenty of shots, but with sniper finder and scavenger mods I rarely ran out of ammo (and if I did- which  happened a couple of times- I'd wait for an ad spawn and clear out with super and/or sword). For Ogres, I'd run right at them with Guillotine; one heavy + one light attack is all it takes. An honed edge shot to the face works too if you are desperate. 

Final note about this room: I highly recommend practicing in sub optimal conditions. After boss-dps phases, I'd load in with low (or no) special or heavy ammo, no super and fight my way out. If you can reliably do that, you are ready. Also, don't stop moving. The ghost kells seem to be playing the game at like 10 fps and will only hurt you if you stand still. 

After a clear (and a deep breath), I'd switch to kinetic sniper (I used my Long Shadow) and Anarchy. Once I was stocked on ammo and super energy, I'd add a High-Energy Fire mod. If all went well, I'd be ready to start DPS with Charged with Light x2 buff. 

**Boss Room**

Most guides tell you to relax and this part will be the least of your worries. Well, I was not good at relaxing here and never found a great rhythm until I ditched mountaintop as my kinetic weapon for a sniper. TLDR; I'm bad with mountaintop. But trying to blast the hobgoblin snipers from a mile away with grenades doesn't appear to work as well on console as it does PC. That forced me to charge with mountaintop and recluse, and it got me into trouble. A sniper still gave me decent boss damage, as well as less stress clearing snipers. I liked this option better than a bow because misses were more forgiving (and I'll take any forgiveness I can with sweaty palms and adrenaline). With this approach, it took me 3+ damage phases (I say 3+ since I finished after my nova bomb in phase 4). 

Writing this was a nice cathartic moment for me to share my glory. I hope you found something useful from this writeup. I don't get a ton of playtime each day, so it took a good week of practicing the fights for me before I felt confident to go for it. I'll be proudly rocking my new emblem until the next dungeon comes out!"

Been a long week of EO grinding for my character, something I'm going to continue into the weekend.  I'm 197 now, at 200 I should be able to unlock new stuff.

I did the Sword of Lost Light upgrade, Radiant Mana Infusions, which was BS.  The ESoLL isn't that great compared to what it takes to be able to get in there -- in the end, I just ran past all the Sclavus Acolytes of T'thuun since I couldn't do more than ~7 damage (11 on a crit) with a maxxed out 430 Heavy Cold Rending weapon.  Maybe there's a trick to that?

Other than grinding XP in EO, my plan for the weekend is to try and get the Gear Shield unlocked and finally start in on doing society quests.  My Shadow armor is finally being replaced with EO Ninja armor, and hopefully I might be able to break into Tier 8 content (legendary keys, Tou Tou, etc) soon.

I took Lockpicking, temporarily, so I can do a bunch of quests that require it.

So, anything going on in your little corners of the multiverse?

Book: Batman

Arc: Time Out

Set: 91

KACHOOOM!

The First National Gotham Bank was in flames as man dressed in a fine tuxedo and red cloak exited the fire with several goons behind him.  No one could see his face behind the featureless ruby red helmet that obscured whoever the leader of the Red Hood gang was.  He looked down at his watch, three minutes to midnight, and everything was finally going right.

“I thought you said you found us a ride!” One of the Red Hood gang members said as he struggled to carry one of the larger bags filled with bearer bonds. 

“Shut up man, you know the boss has a plan,” Another one of the gang said.  “But seriously where’s the car?”

“Car? When did I ever say car?” The Red Hood smiled as the sounds of a helicopter could be heard above.  He had managed to secure Nygma’s services for this one.  For someone who loved stupid puzzles, he could provide logistics in a way the other brokers in New Gotham.  Ropes quickly fell down from the copter to pull the rest of the gang up and into the sky, away from prying eyes. “Only the best for all of you.”

“Nice,” One of the goons said as they grabbed the rope.  “Supprised the Bat isn’t here yet. You’d think she’d noticed we blew a hole in the freakin’ First National.”

“She’s busy playing with a distraction I hired.  Turns out fighting against a supposed crypto-fascist government requires money.  And Peacemaker is a bull in a china shop compared to others,” Red Hood explained.  “Besides, the Bat knows not to mess with me.  Not after what I did to Gordon.”

“Heard he’s still breathing through a straw.  And missing a leg.  Did you really have to feed him to the sharks?” Another goon said as he strapped herself in.

“He was getting too close to my identity.  And our strength is our secrets.  They get out and we’re all just one big…joke,” The Red Hood leader explained.  “Now let's get out of here and discuss shares on the ride.”

“On it boss,” One of the goons said as the four members clicked in and began moving upwards into the helicopter. The Red Hood waited a moment as the members of his gang rose twenty feet in the air the sound of knives cutting through the air could be heard as each rope snapped from the helicopter and the sound of cracking bone could be heard as the gang fell to the ground.

As they withered in pain, the Red Hood turned and saw a familiar grey and blue figure walk towards him in the rain.  The yellow symbol glowed, shining a bat onto the Red Hood.  His timing was off after all as Batwoman stood before him.

“You know you didn’t need to break their legs,” The Red Hood explained as he pulled out two red pistols.  “You make a dramatic enough entrance as is.”

“And let you have the manpower advantage? Not a chance,” Batwoman explained as she held small batarangs in between her knuckles.  Peacemaker had already given her trouble tonight, taking Wayne Medical hostage with her in it.  Luckily he had a glass jaw, but still, the Dark Knight hated distractions, not when there were more important things to take care of. 

“Well, no one ever said you never thought things through,” the Red Hood mumbled as he shot at Batwoman, his semi automatic pistols sending a barrage of bullets towards New Gotham’s savior.

Quickly, Batwoman flared her cape up as the bullets bounced off of them.  Wayne Medical’s recent purchase of armored fabric for hospitals in war torn countries had found another use here in the states.  As the bullets dropped to the ground, the Red Hood sprinted towards her, knife in hand as he sliced through the fabric of the cape and laid a solid punch to her stomach, sending her back winded. 

“Clever cape, but one that can be cut if you know the right people, and have the right blade,” The Red Hood explained.  “See Batwoman, you, much like the former two legged commissioner have been in my way for far too long.  So I’ve decided to clean the house before finally getting some rest on a sandy beach.”

“All this destruction, maiming, and madness…was for you to retire?” Batwoman asked.   “You’re insane!”

“No, just a realist.  And frankly my dear, you don’t interest me at all,” The Red Hood said as he sliced the yellow oval of Batwoman’s suit, the knife crafted from some Atlantean/Kryptonian hybrid metal provided by Lawton.

“I didn’t know it was a popularity contest,” Batwoman mumbled.  She looked at the Red Hood, he was well equipped, smart, and clearly prepared for this fight.  But he had never felt the pain Batwoman had all those years ago, and how Martha Wayne forged herself through long nights cleaning up Gotham, with only Al’s training to begin with.   He didn’t understand just what Martha Wayne had sacrificed to get here.  

Quickly she got up and took a deep breath.  The knife made the Red Hood confident, as if he was invincible because he had the right tool, but every cut he made left him open.  And judging by the protective headgear, odds were he was protecting a glass jaw.  

He kept slicing, tearing the body armor that protected Batwoman, but she didn’t flinch, even as the blood poured down.  

“Why won’t you fall! I’ve cut you to swiss cheese at this point! Do something! Do anything! Make this a chal-”

KRACK!

Batwoman swung with a right hook, shattering the Red Hood’s helmet and sending him towards the ground.  His brown hair and brilliant green eyes.  Batwoman picked him up and looked at him for a moment.  For a man who spent so much time trying to hide his identity, Batwoman couldn’t even place his face, he was just some guy, and no longer worth the attention as the police sirens could be heard.  It was time to go back home, her work was done here.

…

The Gotham cemetery was well maintained for a site on the outskirts of town.  The patrons of New Gotham had made sure that their dead would be memorialized in tombs built from stone.  In a city of neon and glass, this was one of the few places that clung to tradition, as if it didn’t know the Gotham it memorialized had been dead and buried for years.

Tim Drake enjoyed the graveyard shift.  Compared to the rest of his peers, he loved the quiet and the history that surrounded him.  He may have fallen asleep in his first GU class because of the late hours, but he felt comfortable here.  His peers were worried about the internship or club meetings, but Tim found it hard to care.  He got good grades, he was already ahead in his programming final project.  The trouble was he didn’t have a fire or passion for anything.  And it was so easy to feel alone.

His flashlight illuminated the limestone and marble graves, the names of Dagget, Copplepot, even Beaumont told the story of Gotham and how it had fell.  But as Drake’s flashlight bounced around, the light reflected back towards him, blinding him for a moment.  Even after six months on the job he always forgot the large obsidian grave. 

Quietly he moved to it, his hands tracing over the innate carving, done by one of the last stonecutters who made Gotham their home.

“Wayne,” Tim said as he looked at the markings.  

Most of the graves in the cemetery usually had dirt or dust covering them, but the Wayne’s grave was pristine.  The heavy and deep cuts of stone indicated that Thomas and Bruce had made this place their home.  Tim had heard about them, everyone in New Gotham had, but they were distant, martyrs more than people at this point.  And maybe that was for the best, without losing the heart of the Wayne family, maybe things would have been worse.

As Tim watched over the grave he could have sworn he had heard footsteps.  Quiet steps along the gravel paths.  But this was New Gotham, and it was supposed to be safe.

SHINK

Tim Drake didn’t feel the blade go through the heart as he dropped to the ground.  A band of ninjas dressed in purple and blue armor moved from the shadows.  Two of them had shovels and began digging at the ground.  One of the other ninja’s pulled the communicator from their belt and spoke clearly as the rain began to fall.

“We have the body.  We will return soon.”

…

“Ow,” Martha Wayne said as she stitched her own wounds in the mirror.  The penthouse suite in Wayne Tower was considered once *the* place to be to bump elbows with Gotham’s high society.  It was a simpler time, with Thomas regalling people with tales of his work in the DA’s office.  Putting away Boss Thorne and Marroni had made him a hero in so many people’s eyes.  And Martha, in a resplendent gown holding a smaller gathering, explaining the importance of affordable medical supplies and treatments.  Thomas protected the people, but Martha wanted to help them.

It was a promise she had kept for thirty years at this point. After the alley it was all she had at this point.  With the press using her tragedy, her Bruce, to spur on an era of supposed peace.  Pax Gothana it had been called.  The biggest public works, crime, and social program reform occurred because of the influence Martha had wielded.  She could have been Mayor, even a Senator at this point.  But that was Thomas’ dream, not hers.  And that was beyond the fact that someone had to protect this New Gotham from the shadows. 

But Martha Wayne wasn’t getting any younger, at 63, it was becoming harder and harder to ignore the signs of her slowing down.  Someone like the Red Hood couldn’t even slice the Batwoman when she was at her peak, she had taken down the Mad Monk, Hugo Strange, even  The Charlatan.  

“You know, trying to stitch yourself is frowned upon.  Even with someone with your medical knowledge,” A voice said.

Martha turned around to see a familiar face.  His hair was greyer than the last time they had met, but she recognized the smile and confidence of Al Pennyworth, her last light of yesteryear. 

“Yeah, and a butler shouldn’t be wearing a teal shirt,” Martha responded. 

“You’re my partner, not my boss, you made that very clear when you shuttered the manor,” Al explained as he looked over Martha’s body.  The blood on her costume’s top indicated another rough night.  “Take that off before you stitch your costume to your own skin.”

“That’s a bad thing?” Martha joked.  “Would save me time having to duck out of meetings.  And make me virtually bullet proof.”

“And have no life,” Al responded as Martha slid off the top of her suit, revealing a black sports bra and years of scars that never properly healed.  Most people wondered why Martha Wayne had stopped going to most of the galas Wayne Medical had done to keep New Gotham going.  But no make up could hide the cost of that peace on Martha’s body.  “It wouldn’t kill you to find some help, or a partner.”

“It’s my burden Al,” Martha explained.  “What kind of person would I be if I dragged someone else into this life.  After Thomas…after Bruce, what kind of person would I be if I dragged someone into this life.”

“And I’m saying you’re getting too old for this Marty,” Al responded.  “You’ve saved this city, what more could you possibly want?”  He drew closer, peering through Martha’s brown eyes.  Even now, after all these years they could pierce through Pennyworth’s soul.

“You know what I want,” Martha said as she looked away.

“I know,” Al said as he looked to the ground, he had hoped since he had been sent on this mission that Martha would have healed enough to call it off.  But some wounds never truly heal. “And I came back to tell you I lost track of them in the sahara.  After your confrontation with the Al Ghuls’ they’ve run to ground.  And no one has heard a peep from Ra’s or his daughter.”

“Which on-” Martha began before the familiar blue light shone in the sky.  The peace needed to be kept.  “Al, I need to go.  Do you mind providing intel from here?”

“Is the computer where it always is?” Al asked.

“It always is,” Martha said with a smile, knowing that even now, she still had something to fight for.

…

“I wanna make sure everyone clears the area,” Doctor Harleen Quinzel said as the NGCPD circled the graveyard.  She was a profiler for the super criminals that had appeared since the Batwoman had put away that initial batch.   It was a decent gig, one where Harleen could make sure she did a little good.  But with Gordon still in the hospital, Harleen was tasked with handling the super crime of the city.  

She looked at the scene wondering how New Gotham, a city of such promise, wonder, could still have people in the dirt, the falling rain couldn’t wash away what the profiler saw on such a daily basis. 

“Doctor,” Batwoman said as she emerged from the shadows.

“You know ya losing your touch? I noticed you by that big angel.  Why do people think ya needed a giant monument to honor them.  It’s the memories that matter,” Harleen explained.

“What happened here?” Batwoman asked. 

“Oh standard Gotham night,” Harleen began.

“Don’t you mean New Gotham?” Batwoman asked. 

“The place never really changes, new or old, Gotham is always going to be Gotham.  With weird shit like this always happening,” Harleen explained.  “Poor kid got killed by ninjas.  I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.”

“Ninjas?” Batwoman asked. 

“Yeah, apparently the same kind that hunted you, what, two years ago? Their leader was Demon’s Head.  You told Gordon you took care of him, didn’t ya.”

“I did,” Batwoman explained.  Ra’s Al Ghul had came to Gotham to make Martha his bride, believing with her resources and sense of honor and justice. And while Martha was tempted, she had found new love, even if they didn’t want to admit it.  In the fight over the Gotham Observatory, Ra’s had been killed, and his body placed in cold storage.  It couldn’t have been him leading his armies anymore.  

“Well ya didn’t, I got one dead kid and another’s missing body here.  So tell me, what do you think?”

“Missing body?” Batwoman asked.

“Ya, those crazy jerks just dug up Bruce Wayne, can ya believe it? Kid did nothing wrong, and a bunch of losers in pajamas took his body.  Ya think ol; Marty is going to take that well?”

Doctor Quinnzel turned around to see nobody behind her. Nothing but the grove of graves.

“Guess she still got it,” Quinnzel smiled as she went to coordinate the police, somewhere, justice would be found.

…

The ninjas made their way through the dessert, the sand whipping into their face as four of them carried a casket through the heat and slippery terrain.  For many initiates crossing the harsh and bitter lands was a rite of passage, a way to prove to the Demon’s Head that they and they alone would protect their interests. 

Hours passed, and as the dessert became cold, no man stopped.  The Demon’s Head wanted this to be done quickly, so much time had passed since they had seen their beloved.  When the heart is incomplete, nothing else matters.  The acolytes who carried the body understood this.  Their heart believed in the demon and they believed in them.

After a long time they arrived in a temple carved into the sand, the large sculptures of the demon were faded, the face cracked, and the colors long since drained of their vibrant hue when the Demon’s Head first arrived to make his oasis.  As they entered, they could see their mistress. 

“Were you successful?” A woman asked asked as they lowered the casket.  One of the larger ninja’s bowed before the Demon’s Head.  Her purple armor shined against the dull and drab sandstone. 

“Yes mistress,” The ninja responded. “What will you do with the boy?”

“I will grant the detective her greatest wish,” Nysa Al Ghul.  “And then take everything from her.”

92,"Other, non-single shot sniper uses for Phasic Ammo?",MECoOp,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1tzuyl/other_nonsingle_shot_sniper_uses_for_phasic_ammo/,30/12/2013,12,"Just wondering what classes/builds people like to use their Phasic Ammo on aside from BW/Javelin/Widow/Mantis/etc. /u/InterwebNinja has done a (somewhat mathematical) post on the overall merits of Phasic Ammo [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1gi63w/phasic_ammo_discussion/), from what I could find, but again I'm interested in what classes/builds people like to use Phasic Ammo on and their reasoning for it.

Personally I've had some success using Phasic Rounds on light assault rifles (Phaeston, Mattock, or even Geth Pulse Rifle) to turn them dedicated shield stripping weapons on classes with heavy anti-armor abilities like Flamer, Dark Channel, Carnage, or even Incinerate + Detonator.

For example, I've had success (at least, it seems like it to me) with Phasic assault rifles on the Asari Huntress since DC has such a low multiplier against shields and it staggers mooks when cast (or when it jumps, IIRC), allowing for easy headshots. This dramatically speeds up DC's effectiveness, allowing it to do more work on health but dramatically more work on armor against bosses (check the [Kalence numbers](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#50!1304525!!53N51373!E9FB3G)...TC DC DPS is something like 130 against shields vs. 700 against armor on a no gear Huntress). Yes, your weapon won't do as much damage as Warp would against base health or armor, but Warp tends to be in higher demand and gets no multiplier against shields (you can read the full analysis in InterwebNinja's linked post), so against Geth/Cerberus Phasic can keep pace with Warp.

In a similar fashion, I like the Geth Pulse Rifle with Phasic Rounds on the Geth Trooper as a concentrated burst usually strips shields and forces a stagger if I've primed them with a dash of Flamer, setting up more easy headshots.

Basically I like Phasic because it lets me deal with shields easily without resorting to Acolyte or Reegar. If my math is correct, you actually get a lot less effectiveness from Phasic Ammo if you use it on a weapon that has a built-in multiplicative modifier against shields anyway.

I'm considering running Phasic on my Crusader (mainly for Infiltrators), but haven't tried it yet. I guess that's a specific question if someone has tried it/can comment on its effectiveness. But I'd love to hear about any builds/reasoning people have concerning Phasic Ammo, as I've got loads of it just sitting around, and I'm sure many others do as well..."

95,Spawn Power Counter Hypothesis and misc musings,Spawn,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spawn/comments/gw64bj/spawn_power_counter_hypothesis_and_misc_musings/,04/06/2020,1,"Okay denizens of the Spawn universe.  I'm a traveler into your comic lands, but I've been reading the recent runs and I'm pretty blown away by the development.  I haven't been into Spawn since the first volumes in the 90's  when he was still getting first appearances of his rogues gallery.  Very over-the-top and edgey.  Then imagine the next thing I see (in a random comic issue time skip) is a smiling Al, in the middle of a ""uncle"" and teenage! daughter heart to heart.  I'm locked in, 30 issues, light work.  The Horror vibes never got old and quite frankly looked like works of grotesque art.  They frame it so well that at one point Spawn appears to makes Violator seem terrified of him.  Insane.  To start with, to where has Spawn's necroplasm counter disappeared?  He's bliping in and out of existence, traveling through the shadows, summoning the dead like the Pushing Daisies on a kage level.  All without power drain? GTFOH!  When he first used ally respawn in the alley it was a counter drop in the hundreds.  I assumed over time the power counter would get reset or buffed but it still decreases over time.  Side question: Is Al just f\*@'n with people to scare them for his own amusement when he arrives and leaves?  Like he's seen horror movies, he know's Marc is jumpy for all the right reasons, but the best acknowledgement is when he almost apologizes to Marc that he doesn't know why the lights flicker ominously when he enters.  Why are you being creepy on purpose to Marc?  Then outta-no-where, power counter shows back up and is dumb low.  Spawn has been gassing the petal towards zero.  Nonstop teleporting, jail,  Building enforcers slaves from his dead rogues gallery, again like a kage.  He publicly revealed himself, he attacks Trump.  All the smoke.  **Power level gets to zero and starts increasing over time.  My guess is that the souls that can no longer reach the cut off heaven or hell are being absorbing into Spawn himself.**  He set himself up as a new creature to harvest souls and even has his own Reaper.  Since the gods and demons just use those contructs and are something more otherworldly.  He'll gain more spawn acolytes (want to see that ninja spawn), raise his own army, and play the game like god and the devil did or whatever he learned during his silent retreat. Thanks for reading a rant that was homeless for a few days.

tldr.  Spawn learned from Shang Tsung that souls can be collected by anyone if you ask the right way."
96,"[H] Lots of Games, December Choice [W] Paypal, Star Renegades, Phantom Doctrine, Horror Games, Offers",SteamGameSwap,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/zl6bme/h_lots_of_games_december_choice_w_paypal_star/,13/12/2022,6,"I'm mainly looking to get rid of my keys for PayPal.

So make a fair offer and I'll probably go for it.

Otherwise I'm a fan of horror games and roguelites.

I'm not particularly wild about doing a ton of small trades so please try to have trades for $5 or more. All fees are on the buyer.
